# Filemanipulation

File Manager in Python

This project is a File Manager application built in Python, designed to handle basic file operations interactively. It is a simple yet effective tool to practice file manipulation and exception handling, which are key aspects of Python programming.
Features

    Create a File
        Allows users to create a new file.
        Handles errors such as duplicate file names.

    Write to a File
        Users can append text to an existing file.
        Ensures the file exists before writing.

    Read a File
        Displays the content of a specified file.
        Handles errors for missing files.

    Delete a File
        Users can delete a specified file.
        Manages errors like non-existing files or permission issues.

    Interactive Menu
        A user-friendly menu guides users through the available operations.
        Options include creating, reading, writing, and deleting files, along with the ability to exit the program.

Technologies Used

    Python: The entire application is implemented in Python.
    os Module: Used for file deletion.
    Exception Handling: Comprehensive error handling ensures robustness and prevents crashes.

How to Use

    Run the program in your Python environment.
    Choose an option from the interactive menu:
        Option 1: Create a file.
        Option 2: Write content to a file.
        Option 3: Read content from a file.
        Option 4: Delete a file.
        Option 5: Exit the application.
    Follow the prompts to perform the desired operation.

Skills Demonstrated

    File creation, reading, writing, and deletion using Python.
    Handling file-related exceptions like FileNotFoundError and FileExistsError.
    Using loops and conditions for interactive menus.

Potential Enhancements

    Add functionality to browse files in a directory.
    Implement a graphical interface with tkinter or another library.
    Include logging for file operations.
